# neural-network-names-numbers

Building on https://github.com/TheIndependentCode/Neural-Network to create a basic neural network that clarifies hand drawn digits.

The goal it to expirement with activation functions, loss fuctions, network types (feed forward/convolutional) in order to learn the ins and outs of neural networks.
